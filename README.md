Redux Hive aims to help you work with Redux faster and cleaner by providing centralized management of Redux-things (such as reducers, middlewares or sagas) and a addon-system.

Redux Hive has built-in support for ImmerJS, there is no need to install it explicitly. Though, ImmerJS can also be deactivated in some specific handlers if needed.
